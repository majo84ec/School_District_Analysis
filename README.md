# School_District_Analysis

## Overview.

Based on the records from all the schools in the district , we will use Python,Pandas and Jupyter to go through the three-phases of analysis data: Collect (from CSV file and storage in data frame), prepare (clean and format data) and analyze (review the results and get a conclusion).

## Results.
Csv file has information about public and charter schools as student name, school name and type, and results of Math and Reading Tests. One of the analysis showed the average Math score per grade were a little bit higher in Charter schools. specially in 9th and 11th.

However the lowest reading score was for Dixon Charter High Schools.So,Scores can be used as a reference but they can not be a factor which determinate the quality of school.

Also, public schools have more students and more funds available in their budgets but it is difficult predict how the budget impact in the scores.

To have more accurate analysis it is important recognize the outliers of data source, also make additional analysis like grade, number of students vs score test. Moreover,if we want to look more in detail can be found budget per grade or student.
